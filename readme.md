# Portfolio site

A calm static site with:

* Middleman 4
* Webpack 4 as an external pipeline
* ES6
* SCSS

From the repo root, run `bundle install && yarn` to install dependencies. Watch with `middleman server` and build with `middleman build`.

## Notes

* This repo contains submodules.
* You'll have to grab the fonts yourself.
* Google Docs data is pulled through a service account with credentials in `data/service-account.json`, which is not checked in.
