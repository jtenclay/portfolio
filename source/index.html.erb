    Hi, my name’s Jackson. I’m a full-stack web developer from&nbsp;Chicago.
  </p>

  <h2>Development</h2>
  <p>
    I’m currently working at <a href="https://www.discoveryeducation.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discovery&nbsp;Education</a>, an edtech company whose webapps are used by more than 50 million students worldwide; I was previously at <a href="https://multipleinc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Multiple,&nbsp;Inc.</a>, a strategic design&nbsp;firm.
  </p>
  <p>
    Most of my work right now is on the front end, either with older apps written in Backbone/Marionette or with newer projects in&nbsp;Vue.
  </p>
  <%#
  <p>
    Some recent releases include a <a href="https://www.rtamedsafety.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">safety self-assessment webapp for hospitals</a> in React/Redux and a CMS-heavy site for <a href="https://www.sedgwick.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the leading international claims management&nbsp;company</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Spent a good part of last year TAing at Northwestern’s web dev bootcamp on nights and&nbsp;weekends.

  <h2>Not development</h2>
  <%#
  <p>
    Made a font called <a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/35245961/Retrograde-Grotesk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Retrograde Grotesk</a> while studying at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eina.cat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="hover-tile-link" data-hover-tile="eina">EINA</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Performed UX research for various e-commerce stores, with deliverables like heuristic analyses, sitemaps/pageflows, and&nbsp;wireframes.
  </p>
  <p>
    Designed responsive websites ranging from one-off landing pages to international regulation&nbsp;associations.
  </p>

  <h2>Some other things</h2>
  %>

  <%#<p>
    Studying Japanese off and on with&nbsp;WaniKani.
  </p>%>
  <%#
  <p>
    Playing more piano lately. I’ve been keeping track of the specifics in a <a href="/music-log">music log</a> in case you’re&nbsp;interested.
  </p>
  %>
  <p>
    Made a single-font typeface a couple years back that I’d like to find a good use&nbsp;for.

    Currently playing: Princess Peach Showtime&nbsp;😅.
  </p>

  <h2>Buzzwords</h2>
  <p>
    When possible I usually work with Stylus, ES6+, and Webpack 5. I used to be a big React/Redux boy, but I’ve been enjoying Vue&nbsp;lately.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have more limited experience in Ruby, Python, PHP, MongoDB and MySQL. It’s nice that with web development each project is a little different, and there’s often an opportunity to write plugins or scripts in different&nbsp;languages.
  </p>
